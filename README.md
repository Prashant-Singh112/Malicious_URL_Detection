# Malicious_URL_Detection

## This Project aims at detecting malicious URLs using both traditional ML Algorithms (like Random Forest,Naive Bayes,KNN,Support Vector and Decision Tree Classifiers)
and Hybrid Ensemle Machine Learning which uses Voting classifier as its subroutine.

#How to run the project

1)Open the pynb file in either jupyter notebook or Google Collab
2)Load the dataset( malicious_phi) in the content directory.
